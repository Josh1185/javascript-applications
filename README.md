Application: A simple RPG where the objective is to fight off a vicious werewolf, and prevent it from destroying your village. But in order to defeat the werewolf, you must fight other enemies along the way to upgrade your stats.

Purpose: As someone who is new to JavaScript, I wanted to code an old school web RPG and test my knowledge of the language thus far. I was influenced by the Role Playing Game project on freeCodeCamp.org, so I decided to make something similar with my own spin to it.
